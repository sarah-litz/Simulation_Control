Description: Class definition for Map, a network of Vertices and Edges, where vertices are chambers, and edges are the connections existing between chambers. 
            Objects that represent the hardware (subclasses of InteractableABC) in a box are assigned to either an edge or a chamber within the map. 
            All Scripts ( both Control Modes and Simulation Scripts ) rely on an instance of Map to interact with the physical hardware, as well as gain information about Vole location.
