# Control Package

## Quick Start Guide

1. Create a Control Mode
   - use Control/Modes/Example.py as a template for creating a control mode ( copy and paste the file contents into a new file )
2. Setup __main__() so the new Control Mode will execute
   - follow along with the TODO's that are commented throughout the __main__ module in order to add the new Control Mode to the experiment
3. Run the Control Package!
   - positioned just outside of the Control directory, run `python3 -m Control` from the terminal.
