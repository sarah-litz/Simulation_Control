        FORCING AN ERROR so i remember where im leaving off! 
        --> messing around with having door1 where we assign no dependents, and then door2 where we keep the assigned dependents. Because im reaching a point where I think the dependents might be useless??? 
        But very hesitant to do anything because I've referenced dependents so many times throughout the code, 
        so feel like they are serving a purpose that I am just struggling to define potentially.
