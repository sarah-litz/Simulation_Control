[Title] Simulation Executable

[description] this file links a specified simulation class (a file w/in the Simulation/Scripts directory) 
            to run on top of a specified experimental class (a file w/in the Control/Scripts directory).
            
            If you want to change the script that will execute for the simulation and/or experiment, you will need to change the 
            import statements and the statements where the simulation and mode classes are instantiated. 
            This file contains a (TODO) to denote each of the places that these updates should be made.
